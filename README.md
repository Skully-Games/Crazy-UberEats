# Crazy-UberEats*

**Working Title*

These are the source files for the project [Crazy-UberEats,] a game involving a mad race against time to collect and deliver food orders to survive urban life.
Players are on a motorbike, and must collect food orders from places and deliver them to the recipients in time, or have their pay docked. Money earned goes to expenses like petrol, fixing and maintaining the bike, and living expenses like food and such. Any money left after that can go towards upgrades for the bike.


This project is my New Years resolution for 2022: a finished project (or at least a V1.0) by the end of December 2022.

After the last three years in Uni, especially over the COVID years, I found myself increasingly burnt out, and working in what I've dubbed "Survival Mode" to get everything finished as best I can, and call it there. As such, my grades weren't stellar, but they were good enough to pass. 

So now I want to take my skills and create a final project as solo as possible, likely using plenty of Stack Overflow, YouTube, and assets from amazing creators on the net. I can make a game, but I don't know everything.

As of right now, 8th of January 2022, I'm cautiously optimistic, and still reeling from general listlesness and catching COVID over Christmas, so no progress has been made.
